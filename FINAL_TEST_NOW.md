## 🚨 TROUBLESHOOTING

### Issue: Wallet not connecting
```bash
# Solution:
1. Install Phantom: https://phantom.app
2. Refresh page
3. Try connecting again
```

### Issue: Files disappearing
```bash
# Already fixed! Just refresh page once
# Files will stay now (using .on() instead of .once())
```

### Issue: AI not responding
```bash
# Check Ollama status
docker ps | grep ollama

# Restart Ollama
docker-compose restart ollama

# Wait 10 seconds
sleep 10

# Test again
curl http://localhost:11434/api/tags
```

### Issue: P2P feed empty
```bash
# This is normal if no knowledge shared yet!
# Just share something (Test 5 above)
# It will appear within 3 seconds
```
