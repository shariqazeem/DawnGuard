## 🐛 Troubleshooting:

### Issue: Files not showing after upload

**Check Browser Console (F12):**
```javascript
// Should see:
🔑 Vault using wallet: demo_user_...
📂 Loading files for wallet: demo_user_...
💾 Saving to Gun.js: {name: "test.txt", cid: "bafybei...", ...}
✅ Gun.js saved: {ok: 1}
📄 Gun.js file event: ... {name: "test.txt", ...}
✅ Adding file to UI: test.txt CID: bafybei...
```

**If you don't see these logs:**
1. Hard refresh (Cmd+Shift+R)
2. Check Gun.js is initialized: `console.log(window.dawnguardGun)`
3. Should see Gun instance, not undefined

### Issue: "Upload to IPFS" button does nothing

**Check:**
1. Is IPFS running? `docker-compose ps ipfs`
2. Console errors? Press F12
3. Network tab shows request to `/vault/ipfs/upload/`?

**Fix:**
```bash
docker-compose restart ipfs
docker-compose restart web
```

### Issue: Files disappear after page reload

**Check wallet address:**
```javascript
// In console:
localStorage.getItem('dawnguard_demo_wallet')

// Should be consistent!
// If it changes each time, that's the problem
```

**Fix:**
```bash
# Clear and set manually:
localStorage.setItem('dawnguard_demo_wallet', 'demo_user_12345678')

# Reload page
```
