# 🔒 CypherVault - Hackathon Pitch Deck

## Slide 1: The Hook
**"What if ChatGPT lived in your home and never shared your data?"**

That's CypherVault.

---

## Slide 2: The Problem

### Cloud AI Has a Privacy Crisis

- **OpenAI/Anthropic**: Your conversations train their models
- **Google Bard**: Connected to your entire Google profile
- **Microsoft Copilot**: Integrated with your work data

**The cost of "free" AI: Your privacy**

### Real-World Impact
- 🏥 Healthcare: Patient data exposed
- ⚖️ Legal: Attorney-client privilege compromised
- 💼 Enterprise: Trade secrets at risk
- 👤 Personal: Sensitive conversations logged forever

---

## Slide 3: The Solution

### CypherVault: Privacy-First AI

```
Cloud AI:           CypherVault:
You → Internet      You → Black Box
  → Their Servers     → Your AI
  → Their AI          → Your Data
  → Their Database    → Your Control
```

**Three Core Principles:**
1. **Local Only**: AI runs on YOUR Black Box
2. **Encrypted**: End-to-end + at-rest encryption
3. **Zero Collection**: We literally cannot see your data
