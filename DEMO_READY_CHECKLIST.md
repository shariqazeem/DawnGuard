## üéØ JUDGE QUESTIONS & ANSWERS

### Q: "Why build this on the Black Box?"
**A:** "Families need always-on infrastructure. The Black Box is perfect because it runs 24/7, stores data locally, and can serve multiple family members. Plus, local AI means true privacy - conversations never leave the home."

### Q: "How does this compare to existing solutions?"
**A:** "Dropbox and Google Drive charge $10-20/month per family. ChatGPT Plus is another $20/month. Our solution costs nothing beyond the Black Box you already have. Plus, we're 100% private - no cloud company seeing your files or chats."

### Q: "What makes this cypherpunk?"
**A:** "Three things: One, wallet-based auth - no passwords. Two, end-to-end encryption on all data. Three, local processing - your AI never talks to external servers. It's true data sovereignty."

### Q: "Can this scale?"
**A:** "Absolutely. Each Black Box is self-sufficient. The P2P network means they can share knowledge without central servers. And the Solana blockchain handles transaction verification globally."

### Q: "Why should you win?"
**A:** "We've built the most complete, production-ready dApp in this hackathon. We solve a real problem (expensive cloud storage), serve a real market (families), and showcase what the Black Box can truly do. Plus, our UI/UX is stunning - try it on mobile!"
