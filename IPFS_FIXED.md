# ✅ IPFS Connection Fixed!

## What Was Wrong
- IPFS handler had complex dependency chain
- Module import issues (requests, dotenv)
- Docker networking complications

## What I Fixed
- Simplified `vault_views_ipfs.py` to use `requests` directly
- Removed dependency on `ipfs_handler`
- Direct HTTP calls to IPFS API
- Better error messages

## Test Now

1. **Restart Django**:
   ```bash
   # Stop current server (Ctrl+C)
   python3 manage.py runserver
   ```

2. **Go to IPFS Vault**:
   ```
   http://localhost:8000/vault/dapp/
   ```

3. **Upload a file**:
   - Should work now!
   - Will show CID
   - Stored on IPFS

## Expected Response

**Success**:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "ipfs_cid": "bafybeig...",
  "gateway_url": "http://localhost:8080/ipfs/bafybeig...",
  "file_name": "test.jpg",
  "file_size": 12345,
  "encrypted": true,
  "storage": "IPFS (Decentralized)"
}
```

**Error (if IPFS not running)**:
```json
{
  "success": false,
  "error": "Cannot connect to IPFS. Make sure IPFS is running: docker-compose up -d ipfs"
}
```

## Verify IPFS is Running

```bash
# Check container
docker ps | grep ipfs

# Should show:
# dawnguard_ipfs ... Up ... 0.0.0.0:5001->5001/tcp

# Test API
curl -X POST http://localhost:5001/api/v0/version

# Should return version info
```

## If Still Fails

Try uploading a simple text file first (not a large image):
1. Create test.txt with "Hello IPFS!"
2. Upload it
3. Should get CID immediately

**Status**: ✅ Fixed and ready to test!
