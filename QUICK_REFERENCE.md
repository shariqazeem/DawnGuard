## üß™ Testing Commands

### Start Everything:
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

### Run Migrations:
```bash
docker-compose exec web python manage.py makemigrations
docker-compose exec web python manage.py migrate
```

### Create Test User:
```bash
docker-compose exec web python manage.py createsuperuser
```

### View Logs:
```bash
docker-compose logs -f web
```

### Restart After Changes:
```bash
docker-compose restart
```

### Check Ollama:
```bash
docker-compose exec ollama ollama list
docker-compose exec ollama ollama pull llama3.2:3b
```

## üêõ Common Issues & Fixes

### Issue: Port 8000 already in use
```bash
# Find and kill process
lsof -ti:8000 | xargs kill -9

# OR change port in docker-compose.yml
ports:
  - "8001:8000"
```

### Issue: Migrations fail
```bash
# Delete database and start fresh
docker-compose down
rm db.sqlite3
docker-compose up -d
docker-compose exec web python manage.py migrate
```

### Issue: Ollama not responding
```bash
# Restart Ollama container
docker-compose restart ollama

# Check if it's running
docker-compose exec ollama ollama list
```

### Issue: File uploads fail
```bash
# Create media directory
mkdir -p media/vault_files
chmod -R 755 media/

# Check permissions in container
docker-compose exec web ls -la /app/media/
```

### Issue: AI features not working
```
This is OK! The app works in "mock mode" without AI.
To test AI:
1. Make sure Ollama is running
2. Pull model: docker-compose exec ollama ollama pull llama3.2:3b
3. Test AI chat first before vault AI features
```

## üí° Talking Points for Judges

### Opening:
"Hi! I'm [name]. I built HomeGuardian AI - it replaces Dropbox and ChatGPT with ONE Black Box. Let me show you why families will love this."

### Value Prop:
"Dropbox costs $240/year for 2TB. With HomeGuardian AI, families get UNLIMITED storage for $0/month. That's the Black Box paying for itself in year one."

### Innovation:
"This is the first private cloud storage with AI-powered search. Type 'show me vacation photos' and it finds them instantly - no tags needed."

### Technical:
"Everything runs locally on the Black Box. AI processing with Ollama. Encrypted storage with AES-256. Blockchain auth with Solana. True edge computing."

### Family Focus:
"Parents can set up accounts for kids with parental controls. Monitor uploads, set storage limits, review activity. It's like parental controls for cloud storage."

### Black Box Specific:
"This ONLY works on Black Box because it needs:
1. Local storage for files
2. Local compute for AI
3. Upgradable hardware for growth
4. DAWN network for P2P sharing"

### Business Model:
"The app is free. Revenue comes from Black Box hardware sales. Network effects: more users = stronger P2P network = more value for everyone."

### Closing:
"HomeGuardian AI proves the Black Box can replace expensive cloud services. It's not just a router - it's your family's private data center."
