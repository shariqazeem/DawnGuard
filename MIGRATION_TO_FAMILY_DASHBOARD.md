## 🔧 Technical Details

### URL Routing
```python
# Main routes (family-focused)
path('', family_views.family_home, name='home')
path('family/', family_views.family_dashboard, name='family_dashboard')

# Legacy routes (kept for backward compatibility)
path('old-home/', views.home, name='old_home')

```

### Models Used
- `FamilyMember` - Core family model
- `VaultFile` - File storage
- `UserProfile` - Auth settings (wallet, ZKP)
- `Conversation` - AI chat history

### Auto-Creation Logic
```python
# On signup - create FamilyMember
FamilyMember.objects.create(
    user=user,
    display_name=user.username.title(),
    role='admin',  # First user is admin
    avatar_color='#FF6B35'
)

# On wallet auth - create if doesn't exist
FamilyMember.objects.get_or_create(
    user=user,
    defaults={...}
)
```

## 🚨 IMPORTANT

### Before Cleaning Up Old Files

1. **Test Everything**
   - Run through all auth flows
   - Click every link
   - Test on mobile
   - Verify no errors in console

2. **Check for Hard-Coded Links**
   ```bash
   # Search for old dashboard links
   grep -r "href=\"/dashboard" templates/
   grep -r "redirect('dashboard')" core/
   ```

3. **Backup First**
   ```bash
   # Create backup branch
   git checkout -b backup-before-cleanup
   git add .
   git commit -m "Backup before cleaning old files"
   ```

4. **Then Delete Unused Files**
   - Only after verifying they're truly unused
   - Delete one at a time
   - Test after each deletion
