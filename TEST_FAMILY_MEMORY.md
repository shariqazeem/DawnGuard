## üêõ TROUBLESHOOTING

### Problem: Migration fails
**Solution:**
```bash
docker-compose down
docker-compose up -d
docker-compose exec web python manage.py makemigrations core
docker-compose exec web python manage.py migrate
```

### Problem: "Write Memory" button doesn't work
**Check:**
1. Is modal appearing? Check browser console for errors
2. Is CSRF token present? Should be in form
3. Try refreshing page

### Problem: AI summary fails or is boring
**Check:**
1. Is Ollama running in container?
2. Are there entries for this week?
3. AI may need 10-15 seconds to generate
4. If no AI available, you get basic summary (still works!)

### Problem: Entry doesn't save
**Verify:**
1. Both title AND content filled?
2. Mood selected?
3. Check browser console for errors
4. Check Docker logs: `docker-compose logs web | tail -30`
