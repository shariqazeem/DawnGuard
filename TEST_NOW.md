## 🐛 Common Issues & Fixes

### Issue: "Page not found" at /vault/
**Fix:**
```bash
# Make sure you've added the routes
# Check core/urls.py has vault_views imported

# Restart server
docker-compose restart web
```

### Issue: "No module named 'PIL'"
**Fix:**
```bash
# This is OK! Images will work, just no thumbnails
# To add PIL support:
docker-compose exec web pip install Pillow

# Or add to requirements.txt:
echo "Pillow==10.1.0" >> requirements.txt
docker-compose restart web
```

### Issue: "FamilyMember does not exist"
**Fix:**
```bash
# Migrations haven't run
docker-compose exec web python manage.py migrate

# Restart
docker-compose restart web
```

### Issue: File upload fails
**Fix:**
```bash
# Create media directory
mkdir -p media/vault_files
mkdir -p media/vault_thumbnails
chmod -R 755 media/

# Restart
docker-compose restart web
```

### Issue: AI Search doesn't work
**Fix:**
```
This is OK! The app works without AI.
AI features need Ollama running:

docker-compose exec ollama ollama pull llama3.2:3b

If Ollama isn't running, the app uses "mock mode" - still functional!
```
