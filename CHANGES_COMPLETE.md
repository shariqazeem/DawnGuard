## 🗑️ Old Files (Can Delete After Testing)

These files are no longer used:
```
⚠️ templates/family_home_v2.html
⚠️ templates/family_dashboard_old.html
⚠️ templates/index.html
⚠️ templates/analytics.html
```

**How to verify before deleting:**
```bash
# Make sure no code references them
grep -r "family_home_v2" /Users/macbookair/projects/DawnGuard/
grep -r "family_dashboard_old" /Users/macbookair/projects/DawnGuard/

# If output is empty, safe to delete
```

**The old `/dashboard/` route still exists** for backward compatibility, but nothing redirects to it anymore.

## 🎬 Demo Script Suggestion

"When users sign up on HomeGuardian AI, they immediately land on their Family Dashboard. This is the heart of the application - it shows their Family Vault with encrypted file storage, Kids-Safe AI tutor, and their family members.

Scroll down and you'll see we have advanced features integrated - Black Box hardware monitoring shows real-time system stats, Zero-Knowledge Proof authentication for military-grade security, and P2P Network sharing where families can share knowledge on a decentralized mesh network.

Everything is one click away, beautifully organized, and fully functional on any device from your Black Box."
