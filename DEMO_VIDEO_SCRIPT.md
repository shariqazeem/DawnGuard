## 🎯 OPENING - "THE HOOK" (0:00 - 0:25)

### WHAT YOU'LL SHOW
- DawnGuard dashboard open on screen
- Quick cuts: Files uploading → AI responding → Guardian alert → Network graph

### WHAT YOU'LL SAY
```
"Families pay $480 a year for Dropbox and ChatGPT.

You get zero privacy. Google scans your photos. ChatGPT
trains on your conversations.

DawnGuard changes that. Unlimited private storage. Local AI.
Zero monthly fees. All running on the DAWN Black Box.

Let me show you."
```

**[Text on screen: "DawnGuard - $0/month • 100% Private • Unlimited Storage"]**

## 📁 DEMO 1: FAMILY VAULT (0:25 - 1:05)

### WHAT YOU'LL DO (40 seconds)
1. **Drag 3-4 photos** into Family Vault (show upload progress)
2. **AI auto-tags appear** instantly as files upload
3. **Type "vacation"** in search → results appear immediately
4. **Click a photo** → show AI-generated description
5. **Click "Activity Log"** → show what family uploaded
6. **Mention**: "Every file is AES-256 encrypted"

### WHAT YOU'LL SAY
```
"This is Family Vault. Watch me drag some photos in.

See that? AI automatically tags and describes them. No manual work.

Now I search 'vacation' - instant results, even though I never
tagged anything.

Unlike Dropbox's 2TB limit, storage here is only limited by your
Black Box drive. 4TB drive? You get 4TB.

Parents see exactly what kids upload through activity logs.

Everything's AES-256 encrypted. $240 a year for Dropbox?
This is free."

Family safety: Parental controls, activity logs, content
scanning - all built-in.

Sovereignty: Your data on your hardware. No corporate
surveillance. True ownership.

And network effects: Each Black Box strengthens the ecosystem.
True decentralization."
