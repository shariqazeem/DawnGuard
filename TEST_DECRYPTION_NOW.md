# üîê TEST ENCRYPTED FILE DOWNLOAD

## Quick Test (2 minutes)

### Step 1: Start Services
```bash
# Make sure everything is running
docker-compose ps

# Should see: ipfs, ollama - all "Up"
# Django should be running: python3 manage.py runserver
```

### Step 2: Clear Browser Cache & Navigate
```bash
# Open vault
open http://localhost:8000/vault/dapp/
```

**In browser:**
1. Press F12 (DevTools)
2. Go to Console tab
3. Keep it open to see logs

### Step 3: Upload a Test File
```bash
# Create a test file
echo "Hello from DawnGuard! This is a secret message. üîê" > test_secret.txt
```

**In browser:**
1. Click "Choose File"
2. Select `test_secret.txt`
3. Click "Upload to IPFS"
4. Wait for success alert

**Expected:**
- ‚úÖ Alert: "Success! File uploaded to IPFS!"
- ‚úÖ Console shows: `üíæ Saving to Gun.js`
- ‚úÖ Console shows: `‚úÖ Gun.js saved`
- ‚úÖ File appears in table (2-3 seconds)

### Step 4: Test Decryption Download
**Click the "Download" button on your file**

**Expected:**
1. üîÑ Blue notification: "Downloading from IPFS and decrypting..."
2. ‚úÖ Green notification: "File downloaded and decrypted!"
3. üì• Browser downloads the file
4. Open the downloaded file
5. **Should show:** "Hello from DawnGuard! This is a secret message. üîê"

**Console logs should show:**
```
üì• Downloading and decrypting: bafybei... test_secret.txt
‚úÖ File decrypted successfully
```

### Step 5: Test Raw View (Optional)
**Click the "Raw" button**

**Expected:**
- Opens IPFS gateway: `http://127.0.0.1:8080/ipfs/bafybei...`
- Shows **encrypted gibberish** (base64 encrypted data)
- This PROVES the file is encrypted on IPFS!

## üéØ DEMO FLOW

**For Judges:**

1. **Upload file:**
   "Let me upload a file to IPFS..."

2. **Show CID:**
   "See this CID? `bafybei...` - that's content-addressed storage."

3. **Click Raw:**
   "If I view it directly on IPFS, you see encrypted data."
   *(Show gibberish)*

4. **Click Download:**
   "But when I download through DawnGuard..."
   *(File downloads)*

5. **Open downloaded file:**
   "It's decrypted! End-to-end encryption with IPFS storage."

6. **Explain:**
   - File encrypted locally (AES-256)
   - Uploaded to IPFS (decentralized)
   - CID stored in Gun.js (P2P database)
   - Download decrypts on-demand
   - **NO Django database!**

## üêõ TROUBLESHOOTING

### Issue: Download button does nothing
**Check Console:**
- Look for errors
- Make sure IPFS is running: `docker-compose ps ipfs`

**Fix:**
```bash
# Restart IPFS
docker-compose restart ipfs

# Check logs
docker-compose logs ipfs
```

### Issue: "Decryption failed"
**Cause:** File might not be encrypted properly

**Check:**
1. Is encryption working? Look at upload logs
2. Try uploading a new file

### Issue: "Cannot connect to IPFS"
**Fix:**
```bash
# Make sure IPFS API is accessible
curl http://localhost:5001/api/v0/version

# Should return IPFS version info
```

### Issue: File downloads but is gibberish
**Cause:** Decryption might be failing

**Check:**
1. Open browser console
2. Look for decryption errors
3. Check the downloaded file size - should match original
