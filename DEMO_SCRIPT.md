## 🎯 ALTERNATIVE SCRIPTS

### SCRIPT B: More Technical (for technical judges)

**Opening (10s):**
> "HomeGuardian AI - demonstrating DAWN's vision: sovereign computing at home. Two features replacing cloud services."

**Feature 1 (30s):**
> "Family Vault: end-to-end encrypted storage with deduplication, smart indexing, and LLM-powered search. Shows how Black Box can replace Dropbox while maintaining full data sovereignty. $240/year saved."

**Feature 2 (40s):**
> "Kids AI: Local LLM (llama3.2) with safety-first system prompts, content filtering, and parental oversight. Demonstrates on-device AI for sensitive use cases. No data leaves the box. Replaces ChatGPT Plus, another $240/year saved."

**Closing (10s):**
> "$480 annual savings. Zero data extraction. Full privacy. This is what sovereign computing looks like."

---

### SCRIPT C: More Family-Focused (for general audience)

**Opening (10s):**
> "Meet HomeGuardian AI - think of it as your family's private assistant, living in your Black Box at home. Let me show you why families love it."

**Feature 1 (30s):**
> "Family Vault is like Dropbox, but yours. Store everything - photos, videos, kids' school work. Search by asking in plain English: 'Find birthday photos from last year.' It just works. And you're saving $240 a year compared to Dropbox."

**Feature 2 (40s):**
> "Kids AI is the homework helper every parent wishes existed. Safe, monitored, educational. Watch - I ask about math homework... [demo] ...and it teaches, doesn't just give answers. Perfect for after-school help. Saves another $240 versus ChatGPT Plus."

**Closing (10s):**
> "Two features that save your family $480 a year, while keeping everything 100% private at home. That's the power of DAWN."

- **"DAWN"** - the network/ecosystem
- **"$240/year saved"** - concrete value
- **"100% private"** - key differentiator

### Words to Avoid
- "Um," "uh," "like," "you know"
- "I think," "maybe," "probably"

### Body Language (if on camera)

## ⏱️ TIMING BREAKDOWN

```
0:00 - 0:10  Opening (introduce product)
0:10 - 0:40  Family Vault demo
0:40 - 1:20  Kids AI demo (the star!)
1:20 - 1:30  Closing (wrap up, call to action)
```

**Practice with a timer!**

---

## 🎬 CAMERA ANGLES

### Option 1: Screen Only
- Full screen recording
- Clear view of UI
- Cursor visible
- Good for technical demo

### Option 2: Picture-in-Picture
- Main: Full screen
- Small: Your face (corner)
- More personal
- Better connection with judges

### Option 3: Split Screen
- Left: Your face
- Right: Screen recording
- Professional
- Good for explanation

**Recommendation: Option 1 or 2**

---

## 🚨 WHAT IF SOMETHING GOES WRONG?

### If Kids AI is slow:
> "And while it's thinking - notice the safety features here [point]. Content filtered, parent monitored..."

### If Ollama is down (mock mode):
> "This is running in demo mode, but you can see how the AI responds with educational guidance..."

### If you make a mistake:
- **Don't say "oops" or "sorry"**
- Just continue smoothly
- Or pause, take a breath, and start that section again

### If you go over time:
- **Cut the middle**, not the closing
- Skip detailed explanations
- Focus on showing, not telling
