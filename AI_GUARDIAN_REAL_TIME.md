# üõ°Ô∏è AI GUARDIAN - REAL-TIME INTEGRATION COMPLETE

## ‚úÖ IMPLEMENTATION SUMMARY

AI Guardian is now **fully integrated** with real-time data! Every file uploaded to the vault is automatically scanned, and results are stored in the database and displayed on the Guardian Alerts page.

---

## üöÄ WHAT WAS IMPLEMENTED

### 1. **Database Models** (`core/models.py`)

Added two new models for real-time scanning:

#### `AIGuardianScan`
- Stores scan results for every uploaded file
- Fields:
  - `file` - OneToOne with VaultFile
  - `severity` - safe, low, medium, high, critical
  - `risk_score` - 0-100
  - `detected_patterns` - JSON list (SSN, credit cards, etc.)
  - `detected_keywords` - JSON list
  - `risk_categories` - JSON list (personal_data, privacy, etc.)
  - `ai_summary` - Text analysis
  - `recommendations` - What to do about it
  - `parent_notified` - Whether parents got alert

#### `AIGuardianAlert`
- Active alerts that require parent attention
- Fields:
  - `scan` - ForeignKey to AIGuardianScan
  - `alert_type` - personal_data, inappropriate, privacy, security
  - `title` - Alert headline
  - `description` - Details
  - `family_member` - Who should see it (admins)
  - `status` - active, reviewing, resolved, dismissed

---

### 2. **Real-Time Scanning** (`core/vault_views.py`)

Modified `upload_file()` function to:

1. **Read file content** (first 100KB of text files)
2. **Scan with AI Guardian** using pattern matching and keyword detection
3. **Create AIGuardianScan record** with results
4. **Create AIGuardianAlert** if severity is medium/high/critical
5. **Notify admin family members** automatically

```python
# Example flow when uploading "family_documents.txt":
1. File uploaded ‚Üí VaultFile created
2. Content extracted (if text file)
3. AI Guardian scans for:
   - SSN patterns (###-##-####)
   - Credit card keywords
   - Privacy concerns
4. Scan saved to database
5. If risky ‚Üí Alert created for admins
6. File encrypted and stored
```

---

### 3. **Real-Time Dashboard** (`templates/guardian_alerts.html`)

Updated template to display **actual database data** instead of mock data:

#### **Safety Score** - Calculated from database
```django
{{ safety_score }}%  <!-- Percentage of safe files -->
```

#### **Stats Grid** - Real numbers
- Total Scans: `{{ total_scans }}`
- Active Alerts: `{{ alert_scans }}`
- Safe Files: `{{ safe_scans }}`

#### **Active Alerts** - Loop through database records
```django
{% for alert in active_alerts %}
  - Shows: File name, uploader, severity, detected issues
  - Real-time: "{{ alert.created_at|timesince }} ago"
{% endfor %}
```

#### **Recent Scans Table** - Last 20 scans from database
```django
{% for scan in recent_scans %}
  - File: {{ scan.file.name }}
  - Uploaded by: {{ scan.scanned_by.display_name }}
  - Severity: {{ scan.severity }}
  - Risk categories: {{ scan.risk_categories }}
{% endfor %}
```

---

### 4. **Updated Views** (`core/views.py`)

Modified `guardian_alerts_view()` to:

1. Get family member profile
2. Query all scans from database
3. Get active alerts (admins see all, members see their own)
4. Calculate statistics:
   - Total scans
   - Safe scans
   - Alert scans
   - Safety score percentage
5. Pass real data to template

```python
context = {
    'safety_score': int((safe_scans / total_scans) * 100),
    'total_scans': all_scans.count(),
    'safe_scans': safe_scans.count(),
    'alert_scans': alert_scans.count(),
    'active_alerts': recent_alerts[:5],
    'recent_scans': all_scans[:20],
}
```

## üé¨ HOW TO TEST

### **Step 1: Restart Docker Container**

The database needs the new migration:

```bash
docker-compose restart
docker-compose exec web python manage.py makemigrations
docker-compose exec web python manage.py migrate
```

### **Step 2: Upload Test Files**

Go to **Family Vault** (`/vault/`) and upload files:

#### **Safe File** (should show green "Safe")
- Upload: `vacation.jpg` or `homework.pdf`
- Expected: Severity = Safe, no alerts

#### **Risky File** (should trigger alerts)
Create a text file `test_personal_data.txt` with:
```
My SSN is 123-45-6789
Credit card: 1234 5678 9012 3456
Home address: 123 Main St
Password: mypassword123
```

- Expected:
  - Severity = High
  - Detected patterns: SSN format
  - Detected keywords: credit card, password, address
  - Alert created for admins
  - Shows in Guardian dashboard

### **Step 3: View AI Guardian Dashboard**

Navigate to `/guardian/` and you should see:

‚úÖ **Real Safety Score** - Calculated from your uploads
‚úÖ **Active Alerts** - If you uploaded risky file
‚úÖ **Stats Grid** - Actual file counts
‚úÖ **Recent Scans Table** - All your uploaded files

---

## üî¨ DETECTION CAPABILITIES

AI Guardian currently detects:

### **Pattern Matching** (Regex)
- ‚úÖ Social Security Numbers: `123-45-6789`
- ‚úÖ Credit Cards: `1234 5678 9012 3456`
- ‚úÖ Email Addresses: `user@example.com`
- ‚úÖ Phone Numbers: `(555) 123-4567`

### **Keyword Detection**
- ‚úÖ Personal Data: SSN, credit card, license, passport
- ‚úÖ Privacy: address, birthday, medical
- ‚úÖ Security: password, secret, confidential
- ‚úÖ Inappropriate: violence, explicit content

### **Risk Scoring**
- 0-20: Safe
- 21-40: Low Risk
- 41-60: Medium Risk (creates alert)
- 61-80: High Risk (creates alert)
- 81-100: Critical (creates alert)

---

## üìä DATABASE STRUCTURE

```
VaultFile (uploaded file)
    ‚Üì
AIGuardianScan (scan result)
    ‚Üì
AIGuardianAlert (if risky)
    ‚Üì
Admin FamilyMembers (notification)
```

**Query Examples:**
```python
# Get all risky files
risky_scans = AIGuardianScan.objects.filter(
    severity__in=['medium', 'high', 'critical']
)

# Get active alerts for admin
alerts = AIGuardianAlert.objects.filter(
    family_member=admin,
    status='active'
)

# Get family safety score
total = AIGuardianScan.objects.count()
safe = AIGuardianScan.objects.filter(severity='safe').count()
score = (safe / total) * 100
```
