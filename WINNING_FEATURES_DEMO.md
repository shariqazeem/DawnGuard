## üéØ **JUDGE QUESTIONS & ANSWERS**

### Q: "Why would families use this over Dropbox?"
**A:** "Three reasons:
1. **Cost**: Dropbox is $20/month. We're free after buying the Black Box.
2. **Privacy**: Dropbox scans your files, trains AI on them. We never see your data.
3. **AI Guardian**: We actively protect your family. Dropbox just stores files."

### Q: "How does AI Guardian work technically?"
**A:** "When a file is uploaded:
1. Content extracted (text, metadata)
2. Local AI scans for patterns (SSNs, credit cards)
3. Keyword matching (personal data, inappropriate content)
4. Risk severity assigned
5. Encrypted alert sent to parents
All happens in milliseconds, all on Black Box."

### Q: "What makes this cypherpunk?"
**A:** "Four principles:
1. **Self-Custody**: Data on your device, not corporate servers
2. **Encryption**: AES-256, end-to-end
3. **Zero-Knowledge**: ZKP auth option
4. **Blockchain**: Solana for identity, transparent transactions"

### Q: "Can this scale?"
**A:** "Absolutely. Each Black Box is independent. 1 million families = 1 million Black Boxes, not 1 million users on our server. That's true decentralization."

### Q: "What's next after hackathon?"
**A:** "Three priorities:
1. Launch voice assistant (Whisper integration)
2. Expand AI Guardian (image recognition, OCR for documents)
3. Family Memory journals (weekly AI summaries)

Plus mobile apps, but Black Box is the core."
