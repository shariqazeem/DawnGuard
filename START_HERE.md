## 🚨 IF SOMETHING BREAKS

### Quick Fixes:
```bash
# IPFS not working
docker-compose restart ipfs

# Ollama not responding
docker-compose restart ollama

# Phantom wallet not found
# Install from: https://phantom.app

# Gun.js not loading
# Hard refresh browser: Cmd+Shift+R or Ctrl+Shift+R
```

### Nuclear Option (start fresh):
```bash
docker-compose down
docker-compose up -d
sleep 15
python3 manage.py runserver
```

## ✅ READINESS CHECKLIST

Before you practice:

- [ ] All Docker containers running: `docker ps`
- [ ] IPFS has peers: `docker exec dawnguard_ipfs ipfs swarm peers | wc -l`
- [ ] Ollama working: `curl http://localhost:11434/api/tags`
- [ ] Django running: http://localhost:8000
- [ ] Phantom wallet installed
- [ ] Can connect wallet at `/dapp/`

## 🎯 YOUR COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGES

### You Have:
1. ✅ **IPFS** - Actually decentralized file storage
2. ✅ **Gun.js** - True P2P database, no central server
3. ✅ **Ollama** - Local AI on Black Box hardware
4. ✅ **Wallet Auth** - No password database
5. ✅ **Can prove it** - Shut down server demo

### They Probably Have:
