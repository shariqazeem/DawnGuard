## 🎯 Key Things to Check

### Ollama Status:
```bash
# Check if Ollama is working
docker-compose exec ollama ollama list

# Should show:
# llama3.2:3b    a80c4f17acd5    2.0 GB    ...
```

### Test AI Response Quality:

**If Ollama is running (BEST):**
- Responses should be unique each time
- Natural, conversational tone
- Adapts to your questions
- Takes 2-3 seconds to respond

**If Ollama not running (OK for demo):**
- Responses are pre-written examples
- Still look professional
- Yellow badge says "Using demo mode"
- Instant responses

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue: "NoReverseMatch" error
**Status:** ✅ FIXED!
**If you still see it:** Restart containers

### Issue: Kids AI doesn't respond
**Check:**
1. Open browser console (F12)
2. Look for errors
3. Check network tab for `/kids-ai/chat/` request

**Fix:**
```bash
docker-compose restart web
```

### Issue: AI responses are generic
**This is normal!** You're in mock mode.
**To get REAL AI:**
```bash
# Check Ollama is running
docker-compose ps | grep ollama

# Test Ollama directly
docker-compose exec ollama ollama run llama3.2:3b "Hello"
```

### Issue: Slow AI responses
**Normal!** First response takes longer (loading model).
- First message: 5-10 seconds
- Subsequent: 2-3 seconds
