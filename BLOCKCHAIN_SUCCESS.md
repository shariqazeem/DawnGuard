## 💡 What Happens on Solana Blockchain

Your knowledge sharing creates a **real Solana transaction** with:

1. **Memo Program Instruction**
   - Program ID: `MemoSq4gqABAXKb96qnH8TysNcWxMyWCqXgDLGmfcHr`
   - Data: JSON with knowledge metadata
   - Stored permanently on-chain

2. **Transaction Fee**
   - ~0.000005 SOL (~$0.0005)
   - Paid from your wallet

3. **Immutable Record**
   - Can't be deleted
   - Can't be modified
   - Verified by network
   - Publicly auditable

## 🎬 Video Script (For Demo)

```
"Let me show you real blockchain integration.

I'll share some knowledge. [Fill form]

Watch the console - transaction created successfully.

Phantom wallet pops up. [Click approve]

Transaction sent to Solana devnet.

Waiting 15 seconds for network confirmation...

And... verified! Look at this beautiful modal.

Transaction signature, block time, slot number.

Let's click 'View on Solana Explorer'.

There it is - on the actual Solana blockchain.

This isn't a demo. This isn't fake. This is real
decentralized technology.

Your knowledge is now permanently stored on blockchain.

No central server can delete it. No one can modify it.

That's the power of decentralization."
