# DawnGuard - Final Fixes Applied

## ✅ Issue 1: Phantom Wallet Requires HTTPS - FIXED

**Problem**: Phantom wallet won't connect over HTTP, only HTTPS.

**Solution**: Added self-signed SSL certificate support to all deployments.

### What Changed:
1. **Updated `nginx/nginx-http.conf`**: Now supports both HTTP (port 80) and HTTPS (port 443)
2. **Updated `docker-compose.simple.yml`**: Mounts SSL certificates and exposes port 443
3. **Updated `scripts/quick-deploy.sh`**: Automatically generates self-signed SSL certificates
4. **Created `scripts/generate-ssl.sh`**: Manual SSL generation script

### How It Works:
```bash
./scripts/quick-deploy.sh
```

The script automatically:
1. Generates self-signed SSL certificate for your server IP
2. Configures Nginx to serve both HTTP and HTTPS
3. Enables Phantom wallet connection over HTTPS

### Accessing Your App:
- **HTTPS (for Phantom)**: `https://YOUR_SERVER_IP`
- **HTTP (also works)**: `http://YOUR_SERVER_IP`

### Browser Warning:
You'll see a security warning because it's self-signed. This is normal!
- Click "Advanced"
- Click "Proceed to YOUR_SERVER_IP"
- Phantom wallet will now work!

## ✅ Issue 2: Welcome Screen Logic - FIXED

**Problem**: Welcome screen only shows if NO users exist in database. Once someone creates an account, new visitors go straight to dashboard instead of seeing welcome screen.

**Solution**: Changed logic to check user SESSION, not database.

### What Changed:
1. **Updated `core/middleware.py`**:
   - Old: Checks if `User.objects.count() == 0`
   - New: Checks if `request.session.get('seen_welcome') == False`

2. **Updated `core/setup_views.py`**:
   - Removed user count checks
   - Welcome screen now available for all non-logged-in visitors
   - Setup can be accessed multiple times (for creating multiple accounts)

### How It Works Now:
1. **First-time visitor** (not logged in):
   - Sees welcome animation ✅
   - Clicks "Setup" → Creates account
   - Gets logged in → Sees dashboard

2. **Another visitor** (new person):
   - Sees welcome animation ✅
   - Even though DB has users from visitor #1
   - Can create their own account

3. **Logged-in user**:
   - Skips welcome screen
   - Goes straight to home/dashboard

4. **Same visitor returns** (same browser):
   - Session remembers they've seen welcome
   - Won't show welcome again (unless cookies cleared)

### Benefits:
- Every NEW visitor gets the welcome experience
- Database can have multiple users
- Each person gets their own account setup
- No confusion about "already set up" errors

## 🚀 Deployment Instructions

### On Your Server (Ubuntu):

```bash
cd ~/DawnGuard
git pull origin main

# If already running, stop first
docker-compose -f docker-compose.simple.yml down

# Deploy with new fixes
./scripts/quick-deploy.sh
```

### What You'll See:
```
🔐 Generating SSL certificate (for Phantom wallet)...
✓ SSL certificate generated

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
✓ DawnGuard is LIVE!
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

📍 Access your app at:
   → https://YOUR_IP (HTTPS - for Phantom wallet)
   → http://YOUR_IP (HTTP - also works)

⚠️  Browser Warning: Self-signed certificate
   Click 'Advanced' → 'Proceed to YOUR_IP' to access
   This is normal for self-signed certificates

💡 Phantom Wallet: Now works with HTTPS!
```

- [ ] Create different account
- [ ] Should work without errors

### Test 3: Phantom Wallet
- [ ] Visit `https://YOUR_IP` (HTTPS required!)
- [ ] Accept browser security warning
- [ ] Go to wallet setup option

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Phantom Still Won't Connect?
1. Make sure you're using **HTTPS** not HTTP
2. Accept the browser security warning first
3. Refresh the page after accepting warning
4. Try incognito/private window

### Welcome Screen Not Showing?
1. Clear browser cookies
2. Use incognito/private window
3. Log out if logged in
4. Check that middleware is enabled in `settings.py`

### Browser Won't Accept Self-Signed Certificate?
Chrome/Firefox:
1. Type `thisisunsafe` when on warning page
2. Or click "Advanced" → "Proceed"

Safari:
1. Click "Show Details"
2. Click "visit this website"
3. Enter macOS password to trust

## 📝 Summary

| Issue | Before | After |
|-------|--------|-------|
| **Phantom Wallet** | Won't connect (HTTP only) | ✅ Works over HTTPS |
| **Welcome Screen** | Only if DB empty | ✅ Shows for every new visitor |
| **Multiple Users** | Second user sees dashboard | ✅ Second user sees welcome |
| **SSL** | None | ✅ Self-signed (or Let's Encrypt) |

---

## 🎯 For Production

For a production deployment without browser warnings:
1. Get a free domain from DuckDNS
2. Use Let's Encrypt for trusted SSL
3. Run `./scripts/setup.sh` instead of `quick-deploy.sh`
4. See `DEPLOYMENT.md` for full instructions
