# 🚀 Quick Start - After Migration Changes

## What Just Happened?

Your app now redirects ALL authentication to the **Family Dashboard** (`/family/`) instead of the old dashboard. Plus, we added beautiful cards for advanced features (Black Box, ZKP, P2P).

## ✅ What Changed (Quick Summary)

### 1. All Auth Now Goes to Family Dashboard
- **Signup** → `/family/`
- **Login** → `/family/`
- **Wallet Auth** → `/family/`
- **ZKP Auth** → `/family/`

### 2. Family Dashboard Enhanced
Added "Advanced Features" section with 3 cards:
- 🖥️ **Black Box** - Hardware monitoring
- 🔐 **ZK Proofs** - Zero-knowledge authentication
- 🌐 **P2P Network** - Mesh knowledge sharing

### 3. Navigation Simplified
- "Dashboard" → "Home" (clearer)
- All links updated to point correctly

---

## 📂 Files Modified

### Core Logic
- `core/views.py` - Updated redirects in:
  - `register_view()` → family_dashboard
  - `wallet_auth_verify()` → family_dashboard
  - ZKP login → family_dashboard

### Templates
- `templates/family_dashboard.html` - Added advanced features section
- `templates/base.html` - Updated navbar links

### URLs
- `core/urls.py` - Login next_page → family_dashboard

---

## 🗑️ Old Files You Can Delete Later

**⚠️ Don't delete yet! Test first!**

Once you've tested everything:
```bash
# These are duplicates/old versions
templates/family_home_v2.html
templates/family_dashboard_old.html
templates/index.html

# These are unused
templates/analytics.html
templates/settings.html  (if not linked anywhere)
```

**How to check before deleting:**
```bash
# Search for references to a file
grep -r "family_home_v2" /Users/macbookair/projects/DawnGuard/
grep -r "family_dashboard_old" /Users/macbookair/projects/DawnGuard/
```

---

## 🚨 If Something Breaks

### Issue: "Page not found" after login
**Fix:**
```python
# Check core/urls.py has:
path('family/', family_views.family_dashboard, name='family_dashboard'),
```

### Issue: "FamilyMember does not exist"
**Fix:**
```python
# Run in Django shell or create manually:
from core.models import FamilyMember
from django.contrib.auth.models import User

user = User.objects.get(username='your_username')
FamilyMember.objects.create(
    user=user,
    display_name=user.username.title(),
    role='admin',
    avatar_color='#FF6B35'
)
```

### Issue: Old dashboard still showing
**Fix:**
- Clear browser cache (Cmd+Shift+R or Ctrl+Shift+R)
- Check you're logged in fresh (logout and login again)
- Verify URL is `/family/` not `/dashboard/`
