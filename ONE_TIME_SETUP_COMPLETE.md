```

### 2. **Backend Logic** (`core/setup_views.py`)

**Functions:**
- `setup_wizard()` - Renders the wizard (only if no users exist)
- `complete_setup()` - Processes the form data
  - Creates admin user (wallet/password/ZKP)
  - Creates FamilyMember records
  - Auto-generates credentials for family
  - Logs in the admin
- `check_setup_required()` - Checks if setup needed
- `get_setup_status()` - API endpoint for status
- `generate_secure_password()` - Cryptographically secure passwords

**Security:**
- ✅ CSRF protection
- ✅ Secure password generation (secrets module)
- ✅ ZKP secret hashing (SHA-256)
- ✅ Validates all inputs
- ✅ Prevents duplicate setup

### 3. **Middleware** (`core/middleware.py`)

**Auto-Redirect Logic:**
```python
if User.objects.count() == 0:
    # No users exist → Redirect to setup
    redirect('/setup/')
else:
    # Setup complete → Continue normally
    continue
```

**Exempt Paths:**
- `/setup/` (the wizard itself)
- `/setup/complete/` (API endpoint)
- `/setup/status/` (status check)
- `/static/` (CSS/JS files)
- `/media/` (uploaded files)

### 4. **URL Routes** (`core/urls.py`)

```python
path('setup/', setup_views.setup_wizard, name='setup_wizard'),
path('setup/complete/', setup_views.complete_setup, name='complete_setup'),
path('setup/status/', setup_views.get_setup_status, name='setup_status'),
```

---

## 🔄 How It Works

### First Time User Opens App:

```
1. Middleware checks: User.objects.count() == 0?
   ↓ YES

2. Redirect to /setup/
   ↓

3. User sees beautiful welcome screen
   ↓

4. User creates admin account:
   - Wallet: Connects Phantom, generates username
   - Password: Enters username/password
   - ZKP: Enters secret phrase, hashes it
   ↓

5. User adds family members:
   - Enters name + role (Adult/Child)
   - System generates:
     * Username: name + random numbers
     * Password: 8 random characters
     * Avatar color: Random from palette
   ↓

6. User clicks "Complete Setup":
   - POST to /setup/complete/
   - Backend creates:
     * Admin User + UserProfile + FamilyMember
     * Family User + UserProfile + FamilyMember (for each)
   - Logs in admin
   - Returns credentials list
   ↓

7. Success screen with confetti!
   ↓

8. User clicks "Open Dashboard"
   - Goes to /family/
   - Family dashboard loads
   - Setup complete! 🎉
```

### Subsequent Opens:

```
1. Middleware checks: User.objects.count() == 0?
   ↓ NO (users exist)

2. Continue normally
   ↓

3. Show login/homepage
```

---

## 🎯 Key Features

### 1. **One-Time Only**
- Setup only runs if `User.objects.count() == 0`
- Once complete, never shows again
- Perfect for Black Box first boot

### 2. **Auto-Generated Credentials**
- **Username:** `name + random3digits` (e.g., `emma472`)
- **Password:** 8 random chars (e.g., `Xy4jK9mN`)
- **Cryptographically secure** using `secrets` module
- **User-friendly** but still secure

### 3. **Multiple Auth Methods**

#### Wallet Authentication
```
Display Name: Dad
Wallet: [Connect Phantom] → 7xK2...8mP9
↓
Username: wallet_7xK2
Password: [auto-generated, not used]
Profile: solana_wallet = 7xK2...8mP9
```

#### Password Authentication
```
Display Name: Dad
Username: dad_admin
Password: MySecurePass123
↓
Standard Django auth
```

#### Zero-Knowledge Proofs
```
Display Name: Dad
Secret Phrase: my secret phrase
↓
Username: dad
Password: [auto-generated, not used]
Profile: zkp_secret_hash = sha256(secret)
```

### 4. **Family Member Roles**

**Admin:**
- Full access to everything
- Can add/remove family members
- Manage permissions
- Access all features

**Member (Adult):**
- Access to vault
- Can upload/download files
- Access to AI (if enabled)
- Standard permissions

## 💡 For Hackathon Demo

### Demo Script

**Opening:**
"Let me show you what happens when someone boots up their DAWN Black Box for the first time..."

**Step 1 - Welcome:**
"They're greeted with this beautiful welcome screen. Notice the animated particles in the background and the glowing icon. We're immediately communicating the value - 100% private, family-focused, saves $480/year."

**Step 2 - Auth:**
"The setup wizard guides them through creating their admin account. They can choose wallet authentication with Phantom, traditional password, or advanced Zero-Knowledge Proofs. The interface is clean, modern, and guides them every step."

**Step 3 - Family:**
"Here's the game-changer - they can add their entire family right in the setup. We auto-generate secure credentials for each member. No need for everyone to sign up separately. Emma gets her login, Jake gets his, all done in seconds."

**Step 4 - Success:**
"And boom - confetti celebration! Everything is ready. Their Family Vault is encrypted and waiting, the Kids-Safe AI tutor is ready for homework help, and the family hub is live. One click and they're in their dashboard."

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Database Models Used

**User (Django built-in):**
```python
username: str
password: hashed
```

**UserProfile:**
```python
user: ForeignKey(User)
solana_wallet: str (optional)
zkp_enabled: bool
zkp_secret_hash: str (optional)
```

**FamilyMember:**
```python
user: ForeignKey(User)
display_name: str
role: str (admin/member/child)
avatar_color: str
storage_quota_gb: int
ai_chat_enabled: bool
```

### Password Generation
```python
def generate_secure_password(length=8):
    alphabet = string.ascii_letters + string.digits
    password = ''.join(secrets.choice(alphabet) for _ in range(length))
    return password
```

**Why `secrets` module?**
- Cryptographically secure random
- Better than `random` module
- Suitable for security purposes

### Username Generation
```python
def generateUsername(name):
    return name.toLowerCase() + Math.floor(Math.random() * 1000)
```

**Format:** `name` + `random3digits`
- Easy to remember
- Unique (with random suffix)
- User-friendly
